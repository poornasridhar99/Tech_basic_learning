# 🐍 Python Learning Roadmap for Absolute Beginners

---

## Phase 1: Python Basics (Programming Fundamentals)

### 📘 Concepts to Cover
- What is Python and how to run scripts
- Variables and Data Types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `None`)
- Input/Output (`input()`, `print()`)
- Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Assignment)
- Control Flow (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions (`def`, parameters, return)
- Comments and Docstrings
- Basic Error Handling (`try`, `except`)

### 🧪 Practice Tasks
- Print "Hello, World!"
- Write a program to take user input and print it back
- Function to check if a number is even or odd
- Loop to print numbers from 1–100 with FizzBuzz logic
- Write a function that reverses a string
- Create a calculator using functions (add, subtract, etc.)

---

## Phase 2: Intermediate Python

### 📘 Concepts to Cover
- Strings (slicing, methods like `.lower()`, `.split()`, `.join()`)
- Lists (indexing, slicing, `.append()`, `.pop()`)
- Tuples and Sets
- Dictionaries (key-value access, `.get()`, `.items()`)
- List Comprehensions
- Unpacking & Multiple Assignment
- Looping through collections (`enumerate`, `zip`)
- Modules & Imports (`math`, `random`)
- File Handling (`open()`, read/write, `with` statement)

### 🧪 Practice Tasks
- Capitalize the first letter of each word in a sentence
- Build a simple contact book with a dictionary
- Filter even numbers from a list using list comprehension
- Read a file and count the number of words
- Simulate a dice roll using the `random` module

---

## Phase 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### 📘 Concepts to Cover
- Classes and Objects
- `__init__` method (constructor)
- Instance and Class Variables
- Methods
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation & Abstraction

### 🧪 Practice Tasks
- Create a `Book` class and print its details
- Create a `BankAccount` class with deposit and withdraw methods
- Build an `Employee` class with subclass `Manager`
- Implement a simple inventory system using classes

---

## Phase 4: Functional Programming & Advanced Topics

### 📘 Concepts to Cover
- Lambda Functions
- `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`
- Decorators
- Generators (`yield`)
- Recursion
- Error handling with `try-except-finally`

### 🧪 Practice Tasks
- Write a lambda to square numbers in a list
- Use `filter()` to get only odd numbers
- Write a recursive function to calculate factorial
- Implement a custom decorator that logs function calls

---

## Phase 5: Real-World Python

### 📘 Concepts to Cover
- Virtual environments & `pip`
- Modules like `requests`, `os`, `json`
- Web APIs & HTTP requests
- Working with JSON
- Local Storage using files (JSON/CSV)
- Simple command-line interface apps

### 🧪 Practice Tasks
- Fetch and print data from a public API using `requests`
- Save tasks to a local JSON file and retrieve them
- Build a weather app using an API
- Create a CLI to-do app

---

## 🛠️ Practice Project: Task Manager App (CLI Version)

Features:
- Add, delete, and list tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Store tasks in a JSON file
- Use functions and error handling
